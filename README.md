# SAS-Clinical-Trials-Toolset
SAS scripts for clinical trials applications including generating SDTM domains, ADaM datasets, and Define.xml files.

Important: The data and programs in this toolset were derived from Holland and Shostak (2012). However, extensive modifications were made
throughout the data and programs. All the programs are fully tested and correctly functional under SAS University Edition and Windows 10 OS.
